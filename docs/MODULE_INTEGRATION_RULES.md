# MODULE_INTEGRATION_RULES

This document defines exactly how modules may interact.

## Allowed integration channels

### 1. Query
Read-only access to projections or query services.
Use for:
- security pressure lookups
- school availability
- route conditions
- force pool summaries
- grudge pressure summaries

### 2. Command
Intent routed to the owning module.
Use for:
- arrange marriage
- fund study
- expand trade route
- suppress banditry
- mobilize militia
- start campaign

Commands do not guarantee success.
They trigger module-owned resolution.

### 3. DomainEvent
Structured “something happened” outputs.
Use for:
- exam passed
- caravan raided
- branch split
- bandit group formed
- campaign lost

Subscribers may update **their own** state only.

## Forbidden integration
- direct object references to foreign mutable state
- module A changing module B’s private collections
- UI writing into module state
- text templates causing authority changes
- ad hoc global singleton service with cross-module write access

## Event handling rules
- event queues are deterministic
- event ordering is documented by scheduler phase
- handlers must be side-effect limited to owned state
- if a handler needs additional data, it must query published projections

## Projection rules
- projections are read models
- projections may be cached
- projections are rebuilt from authoritative state
- projections are not a backdoor write channel

## Integration review checklist
Before approving a cross-module change:
- Who owns the state being changed?
- Could this be an event instead of a direct write?
- Could this be a query instead of a reference?
- Is the foreign state only being read through projections?
- Is save/schema impact documented?
- Does this keep the feature pack additive?

## Canonical bad example
“ExamPassed directly increments Clan.Prestige and creates OfficeRank.”

Why bad:
- exam module is mutating family and office internals

Correct approach:
- `EducationAndExams` emits `ExamPassed`
- `FamilyCore` handles the event to update its own prestige state
- `OfficeAndCareer` handles the event to open or advance office eligibility

## Current M2-lite integration notes
- `EducationAndExams.Lite` currently reads only `WorldSettlements`, `FamilyCore`, and `SocialMemoryAndRelations` through query interfaces
- `EducationAndExams.Lite` owns study progress, tutor quality, exam attempts, outcomes, and explanation text; it does not write family prestige or office state directly
- `TradeAndIndustry.Lite` currently reads only `WorldSettlements`, `PopulationAndHouseholds`, `FamilyCore`, and `SocialMemoryAndRelations` through query interfaces
- `TradeAndIndustry.Lite` owns clan trade cash/debt state, market pressure, route pressure, outcomes, and explanation text; it does not write household or clan internals directly
- both M2-lite modules emit deterministic domain events and keep outcome explanations derived from queryable state plus kernel RNG only
- `NarrativeProjection` currently reads only the shared `WorldDiff` and `DomainEvent` streams plus its own saved history; it does not emit authority events or write foreign module state
- the current first-pass presentation shell consumes a read-model bundle only; it does not reference simulation modules directly and does not resolve commands or authority rules inside UI code

## Current observability and migration notes
- diagnostics harness reports and presentation debug snapshots now align on the same runtime-only metrics: diff entries, domain events, notifications, and save payload bytes
- those observability summaries are derived after authority simulation and never become a backdoor write channel
- save loading now passes through an explicit migration seam, but current behavior is intentionally narrow: same-version pass-through or explicit failure when no path is registered

## M3 preflight integration notes
- `OrderAndBanditry` currently exposes only settlement disorder query seams plus command/event name reservations; it does not read or write foreign authority state yet
- `ConflictAndForce` currently exposes only settlement force-pool query seams plus command/event name reservations; it does not read or write foreign authority state yet
- neither preflight module is wired into `CreateM2Modules`, active M2 manifests, or the current monthly simulation loop
