# Household Mobility Runtime Candidate Filter No-Touch Proof V605-V612

## Goal

Add focused candidate-filter no-touch evidence for the first household mobility runtime rule after V597-V604 zero-risk-delta no-touch proof.

This pass is owner-test and docs evidence only. It does not change runtime behavior, add a loader, widen fanout, add a second household mobility runtime rule, or change save schema.

## Scope

In scope:
- Add an owner test proving the first runtime rule does not touch already-migrating or high-risk households.
- Add proof that a household below the candidate migration-risk floor is not touched even when the active pool is selected.
- Prove the rule still touches the remaining eligible candidate in deterministic order.
- Add architecture guard coverage that this pass remains candidate-filter no-touch proof, not new authority.
- Update required docs with schema/migration impact and no-authority drift evidence.

Out of scope:
- No runtime behavior change.
- No fanout widening.
- No second household mobility runtime rule.
- No rules-data loader.
- No rules-data file.
- No runtime plugin marketplace.
- No arbitrary script rules.
- No runtime assemblies.
- No reflection-heavy rule loading.
- No direct route-history.
- No household movement command.
- No relocation command.
- No migration economy.
- No class/status engine.
- No recovery/decay formula change.
- No movement ledger, selector watermark, target-cardinality state, owner-lane ledger, cooldown ledger, persisted touch-count state, diagnostic state, or performance cache.
- No `PersonRegistry` expansion.
- Application/UI/Unity do not calculate household mobility outcomes, candidate filtering, target ordering, fanout eligibility, or no-touch status.
- No parsing of `DomainEvent.Summary`, projection prose, receipt text, public-life lines, or docs text.
- No long-run saturation tuning.
- No performance optimization claim.

## Affected modules

- `tests/Zongzu.Modules.PopulationAndHouseholds.Tests`
- `tests/Zongzu.Architecture.Tests`
- Documentation listed in the user-required household mobility doc update set.

No production source changes are planned for this candidate-filter no-touch proof.

## Save/schema impact

Target schema/migration impact: none.

No persisted fields, module schema version bump, root save version change, migration step, save-manifest membership change, route-history state, movement ledger, selector watermark, target-cardinality state, cooldown ledger, owner-lane ledger, durable residue, rules-data file, loader, config namespace, persisted touch-count state, diagnostic state, performance cache, or serialized projection cache is added.

`PopulationAndHouseholds` remains schema `3`.

## Determinism risk

Runtime determinism risk is unchanged because production code is unchanged.

The focused owner test records existing deterministic candidate-filter behavior:
- already-migrating or high-risk households are not runtime candidates;
- households below the candidate migration-risk floor are not runtime candidates;
- remaining eligible candidates are touched in deterministic order;
- no filtered household receives a `Household mobility pressure` diff.

No random choice, unordered authority traversal, IO, prose parsing, reflection, runtime assembly loading, external data reads, counters, caches, or plugin loading are introduced by V605-V612.

## Milestones

1. Add V605-V612 candidate-filter no-touch ExecPlan.
2. Add focused owner candidate-filter no-touch test.
3. Add architecture guard proving this remains test/docs evidence only:
   - no runtime behavior change;
   - no loader or file;
   - no runtime plugin marketplace;
   - no fanout widening;
   - no second runtime rule;
   - no movement authority;
   - no route-history model;
   - no schema drift;
   - no persisted touch-count/diagnostic/performance state;
   - no prose parsing;
   - no `PersonRegistry` expansion;
   - no Application/UI/Unity authority drift.
4. Update required docs and acceptance evidence.
5. Run focused owner/architecture validation plus full build/test hygiene.

## Tests to add/update

- Add:
  - `RunMonth_FirstMobilityRuntimeRuleCandidateFiltersNoTouchMigratingHighRiskOrBelowFloorHouseholds`
- Focused owner test:
  - `dotnet test tests/Zongzu.Modules.PopulationAndHouseholds.Tests/Zongzu.Modules.PopulationAndHouseholds.Tests.csproj --no-restore --filter "RunMonth_FirstMobilityRuntimeRuleCandidateFiltersNoTouchMigratingHighRiskOrBelowFloorHouseholds"`
- Focused architecture test:
  - `dotnet test tests/Zongzu.Architecture.Tests/Zongzu.Architecture.Tests.csproj --no-restore --filter "Household_mobility_runtime_candidate_filter_no_touch_v605_v612_must_remain_test_evidence_only_without_runtime_or_schema_drift"`
- Build:
  - `dotnet build Zongzu.sln --no-restore`
- Diff hygiene:
  - `git diff --check`
- Encoding:
  - touched-file replacement-character scan
- Full no-build solution test:
  - `dotnet test Zongzu.sln --no-build`

## Rollback / fallback plan

Remove the V605-V612 focused test, docs, and architecture guard. No production code or save/schema rollback is required.

## Open questions

- None for this pass. Any future candidate-filter tuning remains a separate owner-consumed rules-data pass.
